# FAIR-Laptop_dataset

In this document, we present the fairification process applied to the 'All Laptops with Specifications' dataset, retrieved from Kaggle, detailing the tailored steps and decision-making processes behind them. The fairified dataset could benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including entities that buy or sell laptops in large quantities, such as universities, companies, and market research institutes.
