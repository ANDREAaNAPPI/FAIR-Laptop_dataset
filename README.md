# FAIR-Laptop_dataset
FAIRification process of a dataste containing laptop specifics

In this document, we present the fairification process applied to the 'All Laptops with Specifications' dataset, retrieved from Kaggle, detailing the tailored steps and decision-making processes behind them. The fairified dataset could benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including entities that buy or sell laptops in large quantities, such as universities, companies, and market research institutes. However, regular people or technology enthusiasts could also benefit from the use of the dataset.


This work is produced as part of the 'FAIR Data Engineering' course at the University of Twente, 2024-2025. All relevant links and documents can be found in the appendix.
